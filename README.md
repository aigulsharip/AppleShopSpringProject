# Lecture4Project

In this project, I have modified existing project from Practice3.

This project utilizes an in-memory databases H2 for storing and working with my databases, containing two tables: Product and Client. I used JPA and JPA repository for accessing table and implementing some methods. 

The purpose of this practice was integration of Kafka to our project. First, I have downloaded and installed Kafka to my computer (version 2.12-2.3.0). Before using Kafka for our project, it should be started by initiating zookeeper and kafka server on command line. Then, configuration for kafka producer and consumer was done. I have created kafka package. In this folder, there are several class that helps running kafka. SpringBootKafkaApplication class should be runned to check the assigment.

Test class was  not changed from practice3 yet.
