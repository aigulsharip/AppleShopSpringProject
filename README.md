# Lecture7Project

In this project, simple Camunda Platform Application with Spring Boot was created. I have watched set of tutorials on how to build and run Camunda Platform Application.
We have stimulated the journal of Lafayette. There were some problems on loading forms and displaying them on Camunda Tasklist, but I have resolved this issue by installing earlier versions of Camunda Modeler (4.8.1). This issue also can be solved by configuring application.yaml file

By doing this project, I have better understanding how Camunda or other process automation platform can be efficient for preparing  workflow of processes and automation of these process. Now I have insight on how banks or other organizations makes automations on their services, such as send some notifications and opening account.
